# Hello World!
Hi, I'm Abayomi Koyejo. Engineer by day and Coder at night. 

Welcome to my website! I started this to share my thoughts, passion and encounters to a wider audience. 

Here you will find posts on various diverse topics and also projects I worked on. 

I have a background in Engineering but I'm interested in everything - art, technology, data science, project management, traveling etc. In my free time, you can find me cuddled up warmly with a book or kindle by myside or on my computer soaking in the knowledge the internet has to offer.

I love collaborating with people so if you have an idea of something fun we can do together. 

Do get in touch!
